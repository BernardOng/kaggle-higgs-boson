o Did Missingness analysis
P Added missigness plot

Conclusions

o PRI_jet_num is a categorical variable telling which of 4 { jets(1,2,3) and no (0) jet }event happened 
o scale all the data except PRI_jet_num  before using algorithims 
o 7 variables are missing more than 70 % of data in training set 
	"DER_mass_transverse_met_lep" 
	"DER_mass_vis"
	"DER_pt_h"
	"DER_deltaeta_jet_jet"       
	"DER_pt_tot"
	"DER_sum_pt"
	"DER_pt_ratio_lep_tau" 

ooo From Kaggle
~~~it can happen that for some entries some variables are meaningless or cannot be computed; in this case, their value is −999.0, which is outside the normal range of all variables


Another reason to not impute -999.0

o Did Numerical and graphical EDA on response variables (Labels and weights) 
P Added 3  histograms for 1) signal ,2) Background and 3) signal + background 

Conclusions 

o Weights and Labels are dependent on each other from chisquare test of dependence
o Signal events have low weights and Background events have high weights
o Signal events weight range is exclusively separated from background event weight range 
o Signal seems to have only three weights Looks like they are looking for three channels of Higgs Boson

o Visual EDA continued
P Correlation Plots , significance , confidence intervals 
P Histograms and density plots of all variables 

?????? Need to check amount of data dependency of all plots

Conclusions
Lots of plots Work in progress

o Reading Documents of Higgs Kaggle Challenge for more insights

-> variables prefixed with PRI (for PRImitives) are “raw” quantities about the bunch collision as measured by the detector.
-> variables prefixed with DER (for DERived) are quantities computed from the primitive features, which were selected by  the physicists of ATLAS

Conclusions

1) Not worth spending time coming up with the formula It's already done for us 


-> it can happen that for some entries some variables are meaningless or cannot be computed; in this case, their value is −999.0, which is outside the normal range of all variables


Conclusions

1)Imputation is a bad idea and wrong because −999.0 is not missing at all 
2)-999.0 indicates nothing is meant to be there
3)## Make a feature indicating level of "Nothingness"

-> The Higgs boson has seen first in three distinct decay channels

#Confirms histogram plot of s vs weights  

-> 

o Finished graphical EDA , final presentable density , histogram , correlation and PCA plots 

-- To do inferences and feature engineering
