Nanda:
* Help Venkat on the Model Ensemble pipeline
* Perform SVM, and Boosting algorithm (varying 6 imputter, 2 scaler, 2 pca, n thresholds)
* Perform XGBoost algorithm (varying 6 imputter, 2 scaler, 2 pca, n thresholds)

  
Venkat:
* Enhance code to extend imputter to include K-Nearest Neighbors
* Start writing framework pipeline code for the Model Ensemble

  
Deepak:
* Featurre analysis - find what predictors have multicollinearity and analyze what can be dropped
* Investigate if features can be dropped based on a mutated new fields using Particile Physics formulas
* Determine what rows/observations can be dropped on missingness impact (if at all)
* Use R or Phython to create visualizations on feature analysis and engineering

  
Entire Team:
* Perform all single basic algorithms + determine what features to use + document all AMS scores
* Start documenting and sending me your materials for slides (in PPT is ok)
* When you're writing code, fork your own first, then after full unit test, merge into higgs_adv_new.py
* Be sure to write code that is self-contained so you do not affect other functions within the entire source file
* stretch goal: create and perform ensemble train/validate/testing pipeline
